            Here are some photos I've taken around the country the last few years.</h1>

I wandered lonely as a cloud
<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,
<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;
<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
<p></p>
Continuous as the stars that shine
<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,
<br>
They stretched in never-ending line
<br>
Along the margin of a bay:
<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
<p></p>
The waves beside them danced; but they
<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
<br>
A poet could not but be gay,
<br>
In such a jocund company:
<br>
I gazed and gazed but little thought
<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:
<p></p>
For oft, when on my couch I lie
<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,
<br>
They flash upon that inward eye
<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;
<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
<br>
And dances with the daffodils.
<br>
- William Wordsworth
